# PyParticles #

PyParticles is a particle simulation toolbox entirely written in python

##Features##

Simulate a particle by particle model with the most popular integrations methods, and it represents the results on a OpenGL or Matplotlib plot.

###PyParticle includes:###

1. Euler method
2. Leap Frog method
3. Rung Kutta method
4. Stormer Verlet method

As a forces model it includes:

1. Gravity
2. Particle by Particle spring
3. Constant
4. User defined field

PyParticle offers an easy to use class structure with a fully interchangable integrations method or force model, it also implements the possibility to add some boudary model.
